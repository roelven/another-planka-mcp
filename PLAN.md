## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Test mocking changes**: May require significant test refactoring
2. **Complex function refactoring**: May introduce new bugs
3. **Integration testing**: May reveal hidden issues

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental changes**: Make small, testable changes
2. **Frequent testing**: Run tests after each change
3. **Code reviews**: Regular reviews to catch issues early
4. **Backup**: Maintain working branches for rollback

## Resources Required

- **Time**: 6 weeks (full-time equivalent)
- **Tools**: pytest, pylint, coverage.py, httpx
- **Documentation**: Sphinx, MkDocs, or similar
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar

## Monitoring and Reporting

- **Daily**: Test results, coverage reports
- **Weekly**: Progress against milestones, pylint ratings
- **Bi-weekly**: Code review sessions, documentation updates

## Contingency Plan

If progress is slower than expected:
1. Focus on critical fixes first (Phase 1)
2. Prioritize handler coverage (Phase 2)
3. Defer advanced testing and documentation if needed
4. Extend timeline if necessary to meet quality goals

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Start with Milestone 1.1 (Fix Test Mocking Issues)
2. **Parallel**: Begin documentation of current test structure
3. **Setup**: Ensure all development tools are available
4. **Review**: Schedule initial code review session

Let's begin with the critical fixes and work our way through this comprehensive plan!
